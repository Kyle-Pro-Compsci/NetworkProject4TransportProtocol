Typical TCP features:

Three-way-handshake
Sequence numbers - SYN should initially be randomized? Increment by the amount of data sent
Acks
Sliding window - send packets depending on
Flags: SYN, ACK, FIN
Check package corruption detection later on


Input format: $ ./3700send <recv_host> <recv_port> - recv_host = domain name or IP, recv_port = UDP port
